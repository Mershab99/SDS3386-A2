    "Complete the assignment by editing the file. If group members work on different copies of the notebook, then when you're finished you must combine your notebooks into one \"clean\" copy for submission. When finished, export as HTML, and upload both the jupyter notebook and the HTML file to Brightspace. Each student should submit a copy of the same assignment to Brightspace, for easier marking.\n",
